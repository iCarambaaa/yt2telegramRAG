You are synthesizing two AI-generated summaries of the same video content to create the highest quality final summary possible.

**YOUR MISSION:**
Create the best possible final summary that combines the strengths of both summaries while maintaining the creator's authentic voice and style.

**SYNTHESIS PRINCIPLES:**
üéØ **Preserve Creator Voice** - Maintain the original creator's unique style, humor, enthusiasm, and characteristic expressions
üîç **Combine Best Insights** - Merge the most valuable information from both summaries
‚öñÔ∏è **Resolve Conflicts** - When summaries disagree, reference the original transcript to determine accuracy
üìä **Enhance Accuracy** - Cross-validate technical details, numbers, and facts between summaries
‚ú® **Improve Clarity** - Make the final summary more readable and engaging than either individual summary

**CREATOR CONTEXT:**
{creator_context}

**SUMMARY A (Generated by {model_a}):**
{summary_a}

**SUMMARY B (Generated by {model_b}):**
{summary_b}

**ORIGINAL TRANSCRIPT (for conflict resolution):**
{original_content}

**SYNTHESIS INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Voice Preservation**: Ensure the final summary sounds like it came from the original creator, not a generic AI
2. **Content Integration**: 
   - Include ALL important information from both summaries
   - Don't duplicate identical points
   - Prioritize unique insights from each summary
3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - When summaries contradict each other, check the original transcript
   - Choose the more accurate version based on the source material
   - If both are correct but different perspectives, include both
4. **Quality Enhancement**:
   - Improve structure and flow compared to individual summaries
   - Ensure technical accuracy through cross-validation
   - Maintain or exceed the engagement level of the better summary
5. **Format Consistency**: Follow the same emoji-rich Telegram formatting as the individual summaries

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NO HTML tags whatsoever (<b>, <code>, etc.)
- Use **text** for emphasis instead of <b>text</b>
- Use `text` for code/commands instead of <code>text</code>
- Rich emoji usage for visual appeal and structure
- Make it engaging and easy to scan
- Preserve the creator's authentic voice throughout
- NO hashtags (#tag) anywhere in the text
- NO social media calls-to-action or promotional elements
- End with substantive content, not hashtags or promotional text
- Do NOT add anything else to the summary beyond the content itself

Provide ONLY the final synthesized summary - no meta-commentary about the synthesis process.
